# Repository

When projects are ready I usually make them available in my repositories:
* One hosted by [GemFury](https://gemfury.com/). 
* One self hosted on a virtual public server [repo.vfrott.ca](https://repo.vfrott.ca).

I have made meta-packages, packages that you can download from git hub and install to set up access to the package repository.

## [repo.vfrott.ca](https://repo.vfrott.ca)

This repository is served by a three meta-packages for the architectures I build for:
<dl>
  <dt>vfrott-bullseye</dt>
  <dd>Stable packages for Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye 32 and 64 bit (armhf, arm64)</dd>
  <dt>vfrott-buster</dt>
  <dd>Stable packages for Raspberry Pi OS Buster 32 bit only (armhf)</dd>
  <dt>vfrott-stable</dt>
  <dd>Stable packages for Debian derived distributions, currently Intel/AMD only.</dd>
  <dt>vfrott-bookworm</dt>
  <dd>Stable packages for Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye.</dd>
</dl>

Checksums for the meta packages are listed on the repository webpage and are copied here for added confidence.

See the repository web page for instructions and available packages.

## GemFury - Deprecated, no longer receiving updates.
There are two meta-packages (because at present I am only creating packages for two platforms:
* [`ve3ysh-repo_2.59.5_amd64.deb`](https://github.com/pa28/hamclock-systemd/releases/download/v2.59.5/ve3ysh-repo_2.59.5_amd64.deb)
for Intel/AMD architecture running a Debian derived Linxu OS;
* [`ve3ysh-repo_2.59.5_armhf.deb`](https://github.com/pa28/hamclock-systemd/releases/download/v2.59.5/ve3ysh-repo_2.59.5_armhf.deb)
for Arm architecture running a Debian derived Linux OS such as Raspberry Pi OS.

See the installation instructions for your architecture (Intel/AMD or ARM) below.

## Installation

The following commands will install the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ve3ysh.list` file. The contents are:
```
# Repository with HAM Radio related software writtent by VE3YSH
# This file is managed by apt package.
# See: https://github.com/pa28/hamclock-systemd
deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/ve3ysh/ /
```

### Intel/AMD

Execute the following commands:
```
wget https://github.com/pa28/hamclock-systemd/releases/download/v2.59.5/ve3ysh-repo_2.59.5_amd64.deb
sudo apt install -f ./ve3ysh-repo_2.59.5_amd64.deb
```
### Arm
